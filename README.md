# MA.PH.EAN: Autonomous Delivery Robot

**Purpose of MA.PH.EAN**  
Maphean is a VEX Robot  created to follow a black trail until it reaches the end, then return to its starting point. It can pick up objects with its claw and drop them off at a destination. With both functions combined, Maphean aims to become a future delivery robot.  Maphean is designed to autonomously follow paths and transport items. It's a simple yet powerful step toward robots that can assist in everyday logistics or automation tasks.
